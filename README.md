# Java 3D Graphics Engine

A sluggish experimental test application for a 3D graphics engine made
from scratch via Java Graphics2D.

## Compile (Gradle)

1. Download and extract anywhere
2. Open terminal in directory with build.gradle script
3. Type: gradle build run

## Instructions

Noclip around in a test 3D environment. All that exists is a 20x20 grid and an upside-down
cone. That's pretty much it.

## Keyboard Input

W,A,S,D => Move the camera forward, left, backward, or right (xy-plane motion)

UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT => Tilt the camera up, left, down or right (camera rotation)
